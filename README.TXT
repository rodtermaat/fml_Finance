PROJECT TITLE: fml Finance (Facilitating Minimal Living)
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:  Create a Java application that mimics my spreadsheet buget and forecast
                     system that I have developed over the years
VERSION or DATE: v0; 01/012018

AUTHORS: rod termaat
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Over the years I have developed a system that combines a budget, checkbook, and forecast of
our $.  It has allowed us to get out of debt and get control over our finances

This is an attempt to write an application for this system.  I was a developer years ago, but
fell into the management bs and lost my skills.  I was a COBOL and .NET developer for many years.
This application is my teaching myself to code again and make something useful - 
at least to me.

The program allow the user to create an initial balance and then enter transactions
into the ledger.  It list the transaction all as a string and keeps track of the ledger 
balance.

v0.1 plans
Next up are to use an actual date and sort the transactions by date.
Also to create repeating entries as the beginning of a template.

v1 plan is to have it functioning with a Db and simple java app.

v? Android app with server and log on capabilities and non profit finanial group
helping people get from financial hell to something more sustainable.

The way out there end state is a fully funtioning financial app that combines
budget, actual and forecasted $.
